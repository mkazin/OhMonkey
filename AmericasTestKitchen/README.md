Notes:
* This was a quick hack to solve the few cases I've needed- it this doesn't work on every kind of page on Amazon. Some pages actually implement this where I avoid breaking things. Please open an issue and paste the link of pages which don't work well.
* TODO: full international support. Open an issue to ping me or create a pull request with the missing @match annotation.
