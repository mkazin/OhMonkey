### Remove BostonGlobe Sports
An attempt at removing anything sports-related from the newspaper.

I think sports are boring, but they're very popular to the locals.
So the Globe dedicates a lot of space to them, in some place creating dedicated space (like the scoreboard at the top of the page).
This script hopes to solve for that problem and reduce the clutter for people who aren't into that stuff.

Please create an Issue if you see other sports content you'd like to hide.
If you can grab a copy of the HTML page and/or a screenshot, that would be very helpful.
