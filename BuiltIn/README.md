The pandemic broke all job search engines for those seeking a job with a physical location.

In the past, if an engine didn't discourage it, large companies who offer relocation often spam-posted their open positions in numerous locations to hijack eyeballs. Now that many are jumping on the remote-first bandwagon, they've taken up this bad practice with remote jobs as well.

Combined with the lack of a precise terminology in the office/remote spectrum or any enforcement of specifying one, what we are left with is a widespread failure of the location filter.
